We're not allowed to distribute the FMOD dlls in the repository. You need to put fmod.dll and fmodstudio.dll into this directory.

You can run "CopyFromFModInstall.bat" (which is located in this directory) to copy the files from the default install location.

See https://github.com/martindevans/SupersonicSound#installation-instructions for more details.
